# DMC Platform — Build Constitution
Below is a **final, commit-ready draft** of your **Build Constitution**.
It is intentionally short, enforceable, and derived **directly** from v5.0 — no new ideas added.

You can save this as:

```
/docs/BUILD-CONSTITUTION.md
```
## Dwayne M. Cyrus Platform

> **Status:** Binding
> **Audience:** Founder, future collaborators
> **Scope:** All code, design, and product decisions
> **Supersedes:** Personal preference, convenience, trend

This constitution exists to **prevent drift**.

If a decision conflicts with this document, the decision is wrong —
unless this document is explicitly amended.

---

## ARTICLE I — CENTER OF GRAVITY

1. **Anchored is the product.**
2. All serious thinking and writing happens in getanchored.app.
3. No content is authored in Voyagers or on the public site.
4. Systems that are not used daily are considered unproven.
5. Dogfooding precedes expansion.

---

## ARTICLE II — PHASE DISCIPLINE

1. Only **one phase** may be active at any time.
2. A phase is not complete until:

   * it is used daily for **14 consecutive days**, and
   * friction has been documented.
3. No features may be promoted across phases without lived usage.
4. Sunk cost never justifies scope expansion.

---

## ARTICLE III — WRITING FIRST

1. Writing is the highest-leverage action in the system.
2. Editor quality takes precedence over:

   * dashboards
   * portals
   * automation
3. Publishing is **always manual**.
4. If writing is compromised, all other work pauses.

---

## ARTICLE IV — FRONTEND LAW

1. **Pure CSS only.**
2. **CSS Modules only.**
3. Class names must be **descriptive and semantic**.
4. Utility-first frameworks are forbidden.
5. UI clarity outweighs speed of implementation.
6. Styling must survive:

   * long breaks,
   * future collaborators,
   * native rewrites.

Violations do not ship.

---

## ARTICLE V — DATA & TRUTH

1. Supabase is the **single source of truth**.
2. Git is **backup only** and never in the write path.
3. Voyagers and the public site are **read-only consumers**.
4. Internal notes never leave Anchored.
5. Data ownership is explicit and non-negotiable.

---

## ARTICLE VI — SCOPE REALITY

1. This system is built **solo-first**.
2. Fewer features beat clever abstractions.
3. Defaults over settings.
4. Anything that requires constant maintenance is suspect.
5. Systems must remain intelligible after long pauses.

---

## ARTICLE VII — AMENDMENTS

1. This constitution may only be changed deliberately.
2. Amendments must:

   * be written,
   * be dated,
   * state the reason for change.
3. Silent exceptions are forbidden.

---

## FINAL CLAUSE

This constitution exists so that:

* tired decisions don’t undo deliberate ones,
* momentum does not replace judgment,
* and the system remains coherent over years.

If in doubt: **build less, write more**.

---

If you want next, I can:

* Reduce this to a **1-screen version** you keep open while coding
* Create a **pre-commit checklist** derived from it
* Or embed enforcement hooks (lint rules, PR template, etc.)

Say the word.
