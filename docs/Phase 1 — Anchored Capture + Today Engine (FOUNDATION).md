# Phase 1 — Anchored: Capture + Today Engine (FOUNDATION)
**Status:** Re-scoped (supersedes v4.x Phase 1)
### Goal
Create a system you **actually open every day**.
This is not a full productivity app. This is a **capture, decide, act** loop.
### Core Capabilities
* Fast capture (frictionless inbox)
* Today list (small, intentional)
* Active timer (one thing at a time)
* End-of-day shutdown ritual

⠀In Scope
* Owner-only auth
* Inbox capture (global, omnipresent)
* Tasks with **minimal statuses only**:
  * inbox
  * today
  * done
* Single running timer (stopwatch only)
* Today View:
  * Today’s tasks
  * Habits (check-off only)
  * Active timer
* End-of-Day Review:
  * Clear inbox
  * Close open loops
  * Decide tomorrow

⠀Explicitly Out of Scope
* GTD completeness
* Areas
* Complex task states
* Pomodoro logic
* Reports
* Weekly/monthly reviews

⠀**If it doesn’t serve daily use, it doesn’t ship.**
