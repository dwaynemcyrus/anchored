Things to consider:
* add the Islamic calendar from World Islamic League
* add dates to show up according to Islamic calendar
* in settings a be able to set when a new day starts according to Islamic tradition
* add ESC-to-close menu'sas a keyboard shortcut
* Grocery/shopping and/or to buy (fu money) list in main menu
* put the timer/date somewhere
* Wire the capture keyboard shortcut
* consider adding a doing now toggle to capture
* kill deletes and delete is moved to another tables or just shows up in a logbook
* turn the inbox review into card that can be swiped
- [ ] can ibox review items have there text edited while in the process?
* Where does a now secondary action og when it is removed, if next and next is at 3 cap what then?
- [ ] Command now needs to add a second 
- [ ] onces theres two system needs to ask to replace prim or sec
- [ ] swap from next places into secondary now if there's a primary, if no primary it promotes to "do now"
- [ ] Swapping or removing always confirms stopping the timer before continuing
- [ ] Remove now from review list
- [ ] when primary now is complete promote the secondary to first
timezone selector needed for time tra stuff and tracker data
- [ ] set the today time to only count from midnight or a predefined time in the settings that marks the end of the day islamically

- [ ] add timeline visualization like TickTick
- [ ] Add a log option for the focus timer to track random activities
- [x] add a logbook screen to view completed or cancelled tasks
- [ ] Focus Note 
- [x] Focus record to show start and end times limited to last 30 entries
- [x] Focus record does not automticlly update after a timer has ended...i have to refresh the page manually for it to show.
- [ ] in sql rename time_entries table > notes to time_notes? But why??? use `time_entry` instead
- [x] add notes field to focus window
- [ ] add an edge case for timers that go way to long with a means to adjust the time before confirming to save or delete like ticktick
- [x] Bug: when the primary now task on the today sheet is marked complete the secondary task should then become the primary task, but it does not. Find the problem and soltion plan. no code
- [ ] Build the avoid habit creation form
